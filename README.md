# ANT+ Examples with Python

This repository contains examples of using the ANT+ protocol with the Python library (`openant`)[https://github.com/Tigge/openant]. 

## Overview

The primary goal of these examples is to demonstrate how to implement a class for monitoring data from ANT+ sensors, including:

- Cadence
- Speed
- Distance
- Power
- Heart rate

## Features

These examples include:

- A **REST API** for accessing sensor data programmatically.
- A **simple web interface** for visualizing sensor data in real time.

## Main Classes
- Metrics: A class that encapsulates the logic for connecting to ANT+ sensors and retrieving data.
